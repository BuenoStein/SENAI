    <h1>The best Turtle from Brasil</h1>
    <h4>why?I will show you</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The biggest turtle in Brazil is incredible! Its grandeur and longevity represent the strength and resilience of Brazilian wildlife. As the guardian of our seas and rivers, this giant turtle is simply AWESOME! 🐢💪
    </p>
    <h1>Characteristics Of The TURTULE</h1>
    <br>
        <h4>1 Unbreakable Shell:</h4>
        <p>Turtles have natural "armor" that is almost like a giant helmet. <br>
            They carry their home on their backs! Imagine going out with your bedroom and living room together.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>2 Super Elders:</h4>
        <p>Turtles are the grandparents of the animal kingdom. <br>
             They may live longer than their great-great-grandchildren and see many birthdays pass by. Some can live more than 100 years! There's a lot of story to tell.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Slow and Steady:</h4>
        <p>Turtles are champions of patience. They are in no rush and like to enjoy the scenery while walking. <br>
             Have you ever heard of the fable of the tortoise and the hare? Well, slowly and steadily you get there!</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Varied menu:</h4>
        <p>Turtles have different tastes. Some prefer fresh salads and leafy greens, while others enjoy a feast of insects or fish.  <br>
            It's like having a buffet of everything you like!</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Professional Divers:</h4>
        <p>Even though they love the water, turtles need to come to the surface to breathe.  <br>
            They are like those swimmers who take an elegant dive, come back for air and dive again. Breathing is essential, even for a turtle!</p>
